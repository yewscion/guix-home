Identify what's not on Cruise Control.  When in doubt, write it down. Start
with top-of-mind stuff. Here are some prompts:

* What do You have to do today? Yesterday? Day Before Last?

* Dangling Tasks? Planned Tasks? Seasonal? Social Events?

* Mail? Email? Work Stuff? Problems? Issues?

* Do a mental walkthrough of common work and life areas.

* Housekeeping Items? Home Maintenance?

* What People have You given attention to recently?

* 20k feet look at your job, what are Your responsibilities?

* 20k feet look at your life, what are Your goals?

* What fun things do You want to do?

* Maintaining relationships? Partner? Pets?

* Is all of Your Gear okay?

* If there were something You haven't captured yet, what would it be?

Things are on Your mind because there is still thinking to be done. Thinking
about each item, ask these questions:

* What is it?

* What's the next step?

* Is it Actionable?

If it is NOT Actionable:
========================

* Is it just something that You need to remember? If so, ARCHIVE it now.

* If not, does it need time to incubate or is it in the far future? If so,
SCHEDULE it and a reminder for it, now.

* If not, is it something You can get away without? If so, TRASH it now.

* If not, is it something that You need or want to do someday, but not soon?
If so, add it to Your SOMEDAY list.

* If not, it is probably more than one item pretending to be one
item. DECOMPOSE it into smaller pieces, now, and repeat with the pieces.

If it IS Actionable:
========================

* Can it be done in less than 2 minutes? If so, do it now.

* If not, is it a long, multi-step process? If so, this is a PROJECT.

* If not, is this something You can hand off to someone else? If so, this is
something to be DELEGATED.

* If not, is it something that will take a long while? If so, this is
something to be DEFERRED to a specific time.

* If not, it is probably more than one item pretending to be one
item. DECOMPOSE it into smaller pieces, now, and repeat with the pieces.
