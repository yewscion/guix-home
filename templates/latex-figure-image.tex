  \noteheader This figure demonstrates the elements of a
  prototypical figure. A \textit{general note} to a figure appears first
  and contains information needed to understand the figure, including
  definitions of abbreviations and copyright attribution for a reprinted
  or adapted figure.

  \textsuperscript{a}A \textit{specific note} explains a
  particular element of the figure and appears in a separate paragraph
  below any general notes. \textsuperscript{b}Subsequent specific
  notes follow in the same paragraph.

  \textsuperscript{*}A \textit{probability note} (for p values) appears
  as a separate paragraph below any specific notes; subsequent probability
  notes follow in the same paragraph.
